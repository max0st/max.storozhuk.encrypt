# max.storozhuk.encrypt
## Overview
This project focuses on implementing a simple file encryption and decryption system using the Caesar cipher and a brute-force with frequency analysis. The system provides both a command-line interface (CLI) and a graphical user interface (GUI) for user interaction.

## Achievements
- Implemented file encryption and decryption using the Caesar cipher algorithm.
- Integrated a brute-force attack with frequency analysis for decrypting files without a known key.
- Developed a command-line interface (CLI) for users who prefer text-based interactions.
- Designed a graphical user interface (GUI) using JavaFX for a more user-friendly experience.

## Project Features
- **CLI Operations:** Supports encryption, decryption, and brute-force decryption operations through the command line.
- **GUI Interface:** Provides a user-friendly graphical interface for performing file operations.
- **Dynamic UI Elements:** The GUI dynamically adjusts its components based on the selected operation (ENCRYPT, DECRYPT, BRUTE_FORCE).
- **File Browsing:** Users can browse and select files easily using the GUI.

## Noteworthy Implementations
- **Caesar Cipher:** The core encryption and decryption mechanism use the Caesar cipher with customizable key values.
- **Brute-Force Attack:** Implemented a brute-force attack with frequency analysis to decrypt files without a known key.
- **JavaFX GUI:** Utilized JavaFX to create an interactive and responsive graphical user interface.
